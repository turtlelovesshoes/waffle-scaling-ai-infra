    <p>2022 Save the Frogs - Project that used a Raspberry Pi and an APCPU Back up battery to keep the water pump valve closed for the Skylonda Mutual Water Comapny Water Cleaning system during power outages. The Frogs were saved in the reservor by keeping the large amounts of chemicals that would be resleased if that valve was left open. ith a Google Drive document</p>

        <p>Project: 🐸🛟 Frog Preserver [aka Save the Frogs, Toad-ally] 
            Date: 2023-06-25
            
            Technical: A Raspberry Pi that detects the loss of utility power (PG&E) and switches off an intake valve to prevent a high concentration of chlorine overflowing into the reservoir of Skylonda Water Mutual Company… and killing the frogs and other wildlife.
            
            Functional: Build a HW device which detects the loss of power (pge/grid) and shuts the main water feed valve from CalWater before an intake tank overflows…
            Chloramine-ating our pond and killing all the tadpoles/frogs. 🐸💀💀💀
            Mixing treated drinking water into our pond, wasting $ and resources
